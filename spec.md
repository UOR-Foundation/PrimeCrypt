# PrimeCrypt Specification

_PrimeCrypt_ is a next‑generation, language‑agnostic cryptographic system built from first principles using the mathematical elegance of the Prime Framework. This document provides a rigorous, unambiguous specification that integrates intrinsic number theory, spectral analysis, and hierarchical chain reductions to form a unified cryptographic construction. The specification details the underpinnings, components, protocols, and use‑cases of PrimeCrypt, leaving no ambiguity for implementors.

---

## 1. Introduction

PrimeCrypt leverages the Prime Framework to redefine cryptographic primitives as emergent properties of intrinsic arithmetic. Instead of relying on isolated hard problems (e.g., discrete logarithm, factoring), PrimeCrypt constructs keys and operations via intrinsic embeddings in a local fiber algebra with a unique minimal‑norm representation. This approach ensures:
- **Leakage Resilience:** Big keys have multi‑base coherent representations that inherently resist partial leakage.
- **Tight Security Reductions:** Spectral analysis via the Prime Operator provides reductions that avoid inefficiencies such as the square‑root gap.
- **Modular Composition:** Hierarchical decomposition (via intrinsic prime factorization) allows natural chain reductions for multi‑signature and aggregate schemes.

PrimeCrypt is specified in a language‑agnostic manner so that its mathematical and algorithmic underpinnings can be implemented in any programming language or cryptographic library.

## 2. Mathematical Foundations

### 2.1. Prime Framework Axioms

PrimeCrypt is built upon the following core axioms:

1. **Reference Manifold (M):**  
   A smooth, connected, orientable manifold \(M\) with a nondegenerate metric \(g\) provides the geometric arena.

2. **Algebraic Fibers (\(C_x\)):**  
   At each point \(x \in M\), there exists an associative fiber algebra \(C_x\) (typically a Clifford algebra) that encodes local algebraic structure.

3. **Symmetry Group Action (G):**  
   A Lie group \(G\) acts by isometries on \(M\) and lifts to each fiber \(C_x\) as algebra automorphisms, ensuring that local representations are consistent under transformation.

4. **Coherence Inner Product:**  
   Each fiber \(C_x\) is equipped with a \(G\)-invariant, positive‑definite inner product \(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_c\) inducing the coherence norm  
   \[
   \|a\|_c = \sqrt{\langle a,a\rangle_c}.
   \]
   This inner product forces multiple representations of the same abstract object to “cohere” into a unique minimal‑norm (canonical) representation.

### 2.2. Intrinsic Embedding and Unique Factorization

- **Universal Number Embedding:**  
  Every natural number \(N\) is expressed in every base \(b \ge 2\) as  
  \[
  N = a_k(b)b^k + a_{k-1}(b)b^{k-1} + \cdots + a_0(b), \quad 0 \le a_i(b) < b.
  \]
  The multi‑base representations are embedded as distinct graded components in \(C_x\). The coherence inner product uniquely selects the minimal‑norm element \(\widehat{N}\), the canonical intrinsic embedding of \(N\).

- **Intrinsic Primes:**  
  An embedded number \(\widehat{N} \in C_x\) (with \(N>1\)) is defined to be an _intrinsic prime_ if every factorization  
  \[
  \widehat{N} = \widehat{A} \cdot \widehat{B}
  \]
  forces \(A=1\) or \(B=1\).

- **Unique Factorization:**  
  Every embedded number factors uniquely (up to ordering) into intrinsic primes. This unique factorization is the arithmetic foundation that underpins key generation, chain reductions, and the spectral analysis of cryptographic operations.

---

## 3. Cryptographic Components

PrimeCrypt consists of several integrated cryptographic primitives constructed using the intrinsic arithmetic and spectral techniques of the Prime Framework.

### 3.1. Big-Key Architecture and Key Generation

#### 3.1.1. Parameters

- **Block Size (\(b\)):**  
  Choose an integer \(b \ge 1\) such that the alphabet size is \(q = 2^b\).

- **Key Length:**  
  Let \(k^*\) be the key length in bits. The number of blocks is defined as  
  \[
  k = \frac{k^*}{b}.
  \]

#### 3.1.2. Big-Key Generation

- **Generation Process:**  
  Generate a key \(K\) as a random element in the set \([q]^k\) (i.e., a sequence of \(k\) blocks from \([q]\)).  
  The intrinsic embedding ensures that \(K\) has a unique minimal‑norm representation in the fiber algebra \(C_x\).

- **Security Properties:**  
  The intrinsic representation guarantees that any adversarial leakage function \(L\) cannot reveal substantial information about \(K\), due to the inherent “coherence penalty” on inconsistent representations.

### 3.2. Subkey Extraction

To use the big key efficiently in cryptographic operations, a subkey \(J\) is extracted:

- **Probe Vector:**  
  Choose a probe vector \(p \in [k]^{(\tau)}\) uniformly at random, where \(\tau\) is the number of distinct probes (indices).

- **Subkey Formation:**  
  Define the subkey as  
  \[
  J = K[p] = \big(K[p[1]],\,K[p[2]],\,\dots,\,K[p[\tau]]\big).
  \]

- **Advantage Bound:**  
  The adversary’s ability to predict \(J\) is bounded by the ratio  
  \[
  \mathrm{Adv}_{\text{skp}} \le \frac{B_{q,k-\tau}(r)}{B_{q,k}(r)},
  \]
  where \(B_{q,k}(r)\) denotes the size of a \(q\)-ary Hamming ball of radius \(r\) in \([q]^k\), and \(r\) is chosen optimally as in Theorem 1.3.1. This ensures a predetermined security level \(2^{-s}\).

### 3.3. Symmetric Encryption

Using the extracted subkey:

- **Encryption Function:**  
  Let \( \text{AE} \) be a conventional symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES). Define the encryption function as:
  \[
  \text{Enc}(K, M) = \text{AE}(H(J), M),
  \]
  where \(H\) is a cryptographic hash function mapping \(J\) to a key of the required length, and \(M\) is the plaintext.

- **Decryption Function:**  
  Decryption is defined as:
  \[
  \text{Dec}(K, C) = \text{AE}^{-1}(H(J), C).
  \]

### 3.4. Identification and Signature Schemes

#### 3.4.1. Identification Protocol

- **Secret Key:**  
  The secret key \(sk\) is represented as an intrinsic number with canonical embedding \(\widehat{sk}\).

- **Interactive Protocol:**  
  The prover uses \(\widehat{sk}\) to generate commitments and responses:
  1. **Commitment:** The prover computes a commitment \(C\) by applying a random transformation in \(C_x\) to \(\widehat{sk}\) (reflecting a random “mask” analogous to a nonce).
  2. **Challenge:** The verifier issues a challenge.
  3. **Response:** The prover computes a response based on the challenge and the intrinsic structure of \(\widehat{sk}\).
  
  The protocol is designed so that the security reduction (showing that an adversary breaking the protocol can solve a discrete logarithm problem) is tight. This is achieved by “lifting” the discrete logarithm problem into the analytic domain via the intrinsic zeta function \( \zeta_p(s) \).

#### 3.4.2. Signature Scheme

- **Fiat‑Shamir Transform:**  
  The interactive identification protocol is converted into a non‑interactive signature scheme using the Fiat‑Shamir paradigm. The signature \(\sigma\) consists of the commitment \(C\) and the computed response.
  
- **Security:**  
  The tight reduction eliminates the square‑root gap by basing the hardness on the deep arithmetic structure revealed by the spectral analysis of the Prime Operator.

### 3.5. Multi‑Signature and Chain Reductions

- **Modular Structure:**  
  Each signer possesses a secret intrinsic key factor, corresponding to an intrinsic prime.  
- **Signature Aggregation:**  
  Given signatures \(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \dots, \sigma_n\) from \(n\) signers, the aggregate signature is computed as:
  \[
  \Sigma = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \sigma_i.
  \]
  
- **Chain Reduction:**  
  The unique factorization property ensures that the aggregate signature retains a tight security bound; each “chain link” (signature component) corresponds to a distinct intrinsic prime factor. This hierarchical composition guarantees both modularity and composability without sacrificing security.

---

## 4. Security Analysis

### 4.1. Leakage Resilience

- **Coherence Penalty:**  
  The intrinsic embedding forces all base‑b representations to agree; any leakage that deviates from this minimal‑norm state increases the coherence norm, thereby reducing the adversary’s success probability to at most \(2^{-s}\).

### 4.2. Tight Reductions

- **Spectral Analysis:**  
  The linear operator \(H\) defined by  
  \[
  H(\delta_n) = \sum_{d \mid n} \delta_d,
  \]
  is used to derive the intrinsic zeta function:
  \[
  \zeta_p(s) = \frac{1}{\det(I - p^{-s}H)} = \prod_{p \text{ intrinsic}} \frac{1}{1 - p^{-s}}.
  \]
  This analytic formulation underpins the tight security reductions in the identification and signature schemes, avoiding the classical square‑root gap.

### 4.3. Complexity and P vs NP Assumptions

- **Locality of Operations:**  
  In the UOR framework, every elementary operation acts locally (on a constant‑sized subset of the state). The impossibility of collapsing an exponential search space using only polynomially many local operations reinforces the separation \(P \neq NP\). This separation supports the assumption that no polynomial‑time algorithm exists that can break the cryptographic constructions of PrimeCrypt.

## 5. Use‑Cases and Samples

### 5.1. Use‑Case: Secure Key Storage and Subkey Extraction

**Scenario:**  
A secure storage device holds a 100‑GB key. When an encryption operation is requested, only a small subkey is extracted using a probe vector.

**Process:**

1. **Key Generation:**  
   - \(b = 512\) bits (block size).  
   - \(k^* = 8 \times 10^{11}\) bits \(\Rightarrow k = k^*/512\).

2. **Subkey Extraction:**  
   - Randomly select \(\tau = 43\) indices from \([k]\) to form probe vector \(p\).  
   - Extract subkey \(J = K[p]\).  
   - The adversary’s advantage is bounded by the combinatorial ratio computed via the Hamming ball sizes.

3. **Encryption:**  
   - Use \(J\) to derive a symmetric key by hashing: \(K_{\text{sym}} = H(J)\).  
   - Encrypt the message \(M\) using \(K_{\text{sym}}\).

### 5.2. Use‑Case: Digital Signature and Identification

**Scenario:**  
A user must prove their identity using a digital signature based on an intrinsically embedded secret key.

**Process:**

1. **Identification Protocol:**  
   - The secret key \(sk\) is embedded as \(\widehat{sk}\).  
   - The user computes a commitment \(C\) by applying a random transformation to \(\widehat{sk}\).  
   - Upon receiving a challenge from the verifier, the user computes a response using operations defined in the fiber algebra \(C_x\).

2. **Signature Generation:**  
   - The interactive protocol is non‑interactively transformed using a Fiat‑Shamir hash to yield the signature \(\sigma = (C, \text{response})\).

3. **Verification:**  
   - The verifier reconstructs the challenge using the hash and checks that the response is consistent with the commitment and the public key derived from \(\widehat{sk}\).

### 5.3. Use‑Case: Multi‑Signature Aggregation

**Scenario:**  
Multiple signers produce signatures on a common message, and these signatures are aggregated into a single compact signature.

**Process:**

1. **Individual Signatures:**  
   - Each signer \(i\) produces a signature \(\sigma_i\) based on their intrinsic secret component (representing an intrinsic prime).

2. **Aggregation:**  
   - The aggregate signature is computed as:  
     \[
     \Sigma = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \sigma_i.
     \]
  
3. **Verification:**  
   - The verifier uses the unique factorization property to decompose \(\Sigma\) and verifies each intrinsic component independently.

## 6. Implementation Considerations

### 6.1. Language-Agnostic Design

PrimeCrypt is defined in a mathematical, language-agnostic manner. Implementors are free to:
- Use any programming language (C, Rust, Python, etc.) for low-level arithmetic.
- Employ existing libraries for Clifford algebras or implement custom routines.
- Map Lie group operations to matrix or operator computations using standard linear algebra packages.

### 6.2. Data Structures

- **Big Key Representation:**  
  Use an array or vector structure of fixed-size blocks (with block size \(b\)) that represents the key.
  
- **Intrinsic Embedding:**  
  Implement the multi-base digit encoding as separate fields or layers in a structured object. Ensure that all layers are maintained consistently (e.g., using a coherence-check algorithm).

- **Operator \(H\):**  
  Represent \(H\) as a sparse matrix or as an on-the-fly computed function where \(H(\delta_n)\) is computed by iterating over divisors of \(n\).

### 6.3. Pseudocode Samples

Below is a pseudocode snippet for subkey extraction:

```
function ExtractSubkey(bigKey, tau):
    // bigKey is an array of length k
    // tau is the number of probes
    p = RandomDistinctIndices(length(bigKey), tau)
    subkey = []
    for index in p:
        subkey.append(bigKey[index])
    return subkey
```

For signature generation:

```
function SignMessage(secretKey, message, randomSeed):
    // secretKey: intrinsic embedded secret key
    // Use a UOR-based transformation for randomness
    commitment = GenerateCommitment(secretKey, randomSeed)
    challenge = Hash(commitment, message)
    response = ComputeResponse(secretKey, commitment, challenge)
    signature = (commitment, response)
    return signature
```

### 6.4. Verification Algorithms

- **Symmetric Decryption:**  
  Use standard decryption routines keyed by \(H(J)\) as derived from the extracted subkey.
  
- **Signature Verification:**  
  Verify that the response combined with the commitment reconstitutes the public key information, using the underlying arithmetic of the intrinsic embedding.
