## Overview

PrimeCrypt is a next-generation cryptographic system built from first principles using the mathematical elegance of the Prime Framework. It offers a unified, rigorous approach to cryptography by rethinking keys, encryption, and digital signatures through intrinsic number embedding, spectral analysis, and hierarchical chain reductions. The result is a cryptographic system that is both highly secure and efficient, addressing longstanding challenges such as leakage resilience, the square-root gap in security reductions, and modularity in multi-signature schemes.

## What Problem Does PrimeCrypt Solve?

Traditional cryptographic systems rely on isolated hard problems—such as the discrete logarithm or integer factorization—often leading to inefficiencies and security gaps. PrimeCrypt tackles these challenges by:
- **Intrinsic Embedding:** Every natural number (and therefore every cryptographic key) is constructed via a multi-base, intrinsic embedding into a local fiber algebra. This yields a unique minimal-norm representation that guarantees consistency and leakage resilience.
- **Tight Security Reductions:** By leveraging spectral analysis of a specially constructed linear operator (the Prime Operator), PrimeCrypt derives an intrinsic zeta function whose Euler product formulation provides tight security reductions. This effectively eliminates inefficiencies like the square-root gap that are common in classical proofs.
- **Hierarchical Chain Reductions:** The unique factorization property of intrinsic numbers allows for natural modular composition. This is especially useful for multi-signature schemes, where signatures can be aggregated securely without loss of efficiency.
- **Robustness Against Advanced Attacks:** The theoretical framework behind PrimeCrypt also reinforces the separation of complexity classes (P vs NP) in a way that ensures no polynomial-time algorithm can undermine its cryptographic primitives.

## Key Features

- **Big-Key Architecture:** Generate and manage keys that are inherently resistant to leakage and side-channel attacks.
- **Subkey Extraction:** Efficiently derive secure subkeys from big keys with mathematically provable bounds on adversarial advantage.
- **Symmetric Encryption:** Use derived subkeys to power robust encryption algorithms such as AES-256 in a leakage-resilient manner.
- **Digital Signatures:** Implement Schnorr-style signature schemes with tight security reductions and efficient verification.
- **Multi-Signature Aggregation:** Aggregate individual signatures securely via chain reduction techniques, enabling scalable multi-party signing.
